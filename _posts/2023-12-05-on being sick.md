As the title suggests, I'm sick. The issue is, it's not your usual cough or fever sick. My body is itchy and has hives all over, which for all I know, could be the result of an allergy to a wide expanse of allergens.

So for now I'm stuck at home because my parents are afraid I might stop breathing. And I'm not going to lie, it's pretty nice (if you ignore the part where I have hives and itch everywhere). I've gotten the chance to work on some essays, work on my arduino project, and do all the homework and work I've been missing so far. Also my parents have been drowning me with the amount of water they want me to drink, which is fair. But the way I choke and gag every time I try to drink large quantities of water at once is sooooo annoying ;-;

Hopefully this goes away soon and I can go back to school because I miss interacting with people. All this project time is fun, but it gets lonely.

On another note, green beans are actually so good. Like, you wouldn't expect them to be so good just boiled but they are!!! Maybe school food has marred by sense of taste.
