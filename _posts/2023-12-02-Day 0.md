Whoa! We did it! I'm not going to lie, this is more like day 0 and day 0.5 (the next morning at 6am) because it took HOURS to get this setup. Lemme tell you, Github Pages has made some significant changes in the past year and the official Github guides do a abhorrent amount of redirecting... 

I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do about this other than just talk about stuff I've learned and how life is going, but it feels weird because I'm just writing to myself. Guess it's like writing in a diary but 100% cooler. Maybe that means I should introduce myself a little bit! 

About myself:
* I'm a high schooler!
* Currently working on a Morse Code android app - maybe that'll be on this one day!
* I don't really have a singular favorite subject in school. If I had to choose, math, chemistry, and English would probably be at the top of the list.
* My favorite book is <ins>Looking for Alaska</ins> and right now I'm reading King Lear (for AP Lit) and the Demonata series

That's it for now because I need to head out o/

P.S. I really hope this works because this is my first time using markdown... even though its simpler than HTML for now.

Post-Posting (???) Update: It worked!!! I'll get the logo and any other personalizable things patched up when I'm home :D
